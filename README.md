# CO2-prediction

This repository contains my codes and writeup for a CO2 prediction project. From the Mauna Loa CO2 data set (recorded weekly from 1958), I apply Bayesian Inference to build a predictive model to forecast when Earth CO2 level reaches climate danger threshold. The forecast matches [scientists' projection](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-will-cross-the-climate-danger-threshold-by-2036/).
